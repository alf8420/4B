/*
This program was writing by Alfonso Contreras
for the class CPE 301, with Dr. Venkatesan Muthukumar
and what this program does is to control a servo motor
which rotates from 0 to 180 degrees and it could be 
control with a potentiometer, when this one is @ 0 volts
it does not rotate, but when the potentiometer is with less
resistance @ 5 volts it allows the servo rotate 180 degrees.
